# Object-oriented programming in R

Object-oriented programming (OOP) can help us encapsulate complex data structures in a simple interface. This is especially important when writing code that is meant to be re-used by other people. In that situation it's useful to make a distinction between you, _the developer_, and you _users_. You will have absolute knowledge of the code and data structure, and will want to present a simple way for the user to interact with it, that doesn't require this full knowledge. It can also help you write simpler and more robust code in the long run. 

Unlike other main-stream languages, R has multiple OOP systems that co-exist in parallel:

- S3 - used in base R
- S4 - _de-facto_ standard in Bioconductor
- Reference classes (RC) - used in special use cases

S3 and S4 are similar, but S4 is more formal. RC is quite different and is Java-like. 

## OOP concepts

- Abstraction - related data is stored and handled together
- Polymorphism - the most appropriate function is called based on the object type (e.g various plot functions)
- Inheritance - code reuse by hierarchy of more-to-less general object types

In R, everything has a class (i.e type):

```{r}
class("Hello")
class(1:5)
class(2.1)
class(table(c(1,4,5,3,2,1)))
class(plot)
x = 10
class(x)
```
