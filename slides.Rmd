# What is data analysis

The ability to prepare and **explore** data, identify **patterns**
(good and pathological ones) and convince oneself that the pattern are
**genuine** (rather than random).

# To analyse data, you need

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~
* Knowledge about the domain
* Know about your data
* Be able to manipulate/visualise it
* How good do we need to be?

* How good do we need to be? **Good enough!**

# Quantitative proteomics data analysis

* What data do we have?
* What analyses can we apply?

# Quantitative proteomics data analysis

* **Replicates**: technical and biological
* **Variability**: technical vs biological
* **Normalisation**: remove unwanted (technical) variation while
  retaining biological variability.


# Visualisation

> A picture is worth a thousand words.

> Graphics reveal data.

# Proteomics data analysis

# Data analysis tools

should enables you to manipulate your data, give some guarantees about
the integrity of the data, support effective extract/subset components
of the data, visualise them, enable transformation of the data, give
access to infrastucture for statistical analysis, and enable
annotation of the data. 

# Data analysis basics

* Storing data as *computational objects* (rigorously defined data
  structures): knowing where to find things
* Consistency in data structures (and conventions)
* *Application programming interface*: how to
  manipluate/transform/visualise these data

# The `MSnSet` class for quantitative data

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
* Expression/quantitative data
* Feature meta-data
* Sample meta-data
* Dimension constrains

Can be subsetted, transformed, visualised, annotated, statistics, ...
