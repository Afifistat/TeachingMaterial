# What is data analysis

The ability to prepare and **explore** data, identify **patterns**
(good and pathological ones) and convince oneself that the pattern are
**genuine** (rather than random).

# To analyse data, you need

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~

# To analyse data, you need

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~
* Knowledge about the domain
* Know about your data
* Be able to manipulate/visualise it
* How good do we need to be? Good enough! 

# Data analysis

# Definitions

**Variability**: technical vs biological

**Replicates**: ...

**Normalisation**: remove unwanted (technical) variation while retaining
biological variability.

(see also stats course)

# Visualisation

> A picture is worth a thousand words.

> Graphics reveal data.

# Proteomics data analysis


# Data analysis basics

* Storing data as *computational objects* (rigorously defined data
  structures): knowing where to find things
* *Application programming interface*
* Tidy data: consistency in data structures (and conventions)



# The `MSnSet` class for quantitative data

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
* Expression/quantitative data
* Feature meta-data
* Sample meta-data
* Dimension constrains
