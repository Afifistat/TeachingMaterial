# Data structures in R

## Basic data structures


```{r, echo = FALSE}
structs <-
    data.frame(dimensions = c(1, 2, 2, 1, "n"),
               'Data types' = c(1, 1, "n (1 per column)", "n", 1),
               row.names = c("vector", "matrix", "data.frame",
                             "list", "array"))
knitr::kable(structs)
```

## Specialised data structures

Such specialised data structures, also called *classes* are

- **defined** for specialised domains like proteomics, genomics
  (micro-arrays, high-throughput sequencing, ...)

- **composed** of basic data structures like those summarised above (and
  others) that store bits that form the specialised *class*
  
- All parts are **contained/unified** into one *class* and are
  manipulated/processed consistently.
  
We will see several of these proteomics *ad hoc* classes (for
quantitative data, for PSMs identification, for raw mass spectrometry
data) and how to use them throughout the workshop.
