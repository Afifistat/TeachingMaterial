- A simple series of BPI chromatograms, usually shown as a bitmap -
  why not plot them from exported data?

- A series of panels that show the MS spectrum of a a SILAC
  heavy/light pair, in a nice diagram

- A set of protein LFQ data let’s say - two conditions, with 6
  replicates of each, and with a list of protein accession number and
  the LFQ data:

- This is a fabulous dataset for 

- S curves for means of both, with errors Matrix plot of all against
  all

- Normalisation strategies

- Heatmap plot

- Hierarchical clustering (with or without heatmap)

- Volcano plots

- PCA analysis and plots

- Abundance histograms

- From a simpler set (e.g. Dean’s kdeg/protein/abundance) data, plot a
  2d plot with colour as a third scaling variable
