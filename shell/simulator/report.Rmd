# The simulator

The script simulator.R will generate N samples drawn from some random
distribution.  The value of N is given in the file `params.R` which
simply sets N as:

<!-- Show the contents of a params.R file here -->

For example, here we run the script to genarate samples from the
uniform distribution.

```{r, engine='bash',eval=FALSE}
Rscript simulator.R runif
```

# Plotting the Normal distribution

This is an example of the histogram of the Normal distribution:

![Histogram](sim1.png "Histogram of sim1.dat")

# Histogram of the Uniform distribution

This is an example of the histogram of the Normal distribution:

![Histogram](sim2.png "Histogram of sim2.dat")

# Exercises

* Compile the document for yourself.
* Change N to e.g. 1000 to see what happens when you "make".
* What happens when you change the plotting function (e.g. add
  xlab='...' to the hist call) -- what should be regenerated?
* Silence the first block of code by changing eval keyword to
  something obvious
* See the effect of caching:
	1. Set n to 1e6 in `params.R`
	2. "make"
	3. "touch report.Rmd"
	4. "make"
	5. "make"
