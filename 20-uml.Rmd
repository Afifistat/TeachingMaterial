# Unsupervised learning

In **unsupervised learning** (UML), no labels are provided, and the
learning algorithm focuses solelt on detecting structure in unlabelled
input data. One generally differentiates between


- **clustering**: find homogeneous subgroups within larger groups
  (based on some sort of distance)
- **dimensional reduction**: find patterns in the features of the
  data, often used to enable visualisation and as a pre-processing
  method before supervised learning.


Challenges and benefits:
- no single goals
- much more unlabelled data that (clean) labelled data is available
