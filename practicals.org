* Practical 1 - Dynamic models in Biology, up to exercise 9.

- The looping exercices just that; there are ways to do the same without for loops. 
- Exercise 6.4: identical is more that all(x == y) - read ?identical

#+begin_src R :results output
  y <- x <- 1:5
  x == y
  all(x == y)
  identical(x, y)
  names(x) <- letters[1:5]
  names(y) <- LETTERS[1:5]
  all(x == y)
  identical(x, y)
#+end_src

- Exercise 7.1: the if/else script can be simplified!
- Numerical Matrix Algebra: R uses the BLAS and LAPACK libraries.

* Practical 2 - LaTeX

* Practical 3 - Assignment 1

* Practical 4 - Reproducible research with Sweave
