# Open Science

> Who owns the research outputs? Who should have access to research outputs?

Science is supported by **public** funds. All outputs should thus be
made publicly and openly available - to the research community and the
general public.

**Open** means free from any fees (*free as in beer*) and free from
any re-use restrictions (*free as in speech*).

#### Open data

The **data**, both in raw and processed form, and its annotation
(**metadata**) that accompanies a scientific paper (discovery) should
be freely/publicly available and should be free to re-use.

#### Open methodology

> An open methodology is simply one which has been described in
> sufficient detail to allow other researchers to repeat the work and
> apply it elsewhere (from Waton M., 2015)

Describe and release the process that lead raw data to processed data,
and how the processed data has been further analysed to lead to
results, figures and conclusions.

- **[Open source](http://opensource.org/osd)**: the source code of
  your (scienfic) software should be openly released, so that others
  can read/understand/fix/re-use it. (see
  [software licences](http://opensource.org/licenses))

- **Open protocols**: openly share the hole sample processing, data
  acquisition.

#### Open access

Papers and supplementary material should be available to **read** and
**mine** by all, researchers and public.
