# Open Science

> Who owns the research outputs? Who should have access to research outputs?

Science is supported by **public** funds. All outputs should thus
arguably be made publicly and openly available - to the research
community and the general public.

**Open** means free from any fees (*free as in beer*) and free from
any (copyright, patents, ...) restrictions to re-use (*free as in
speech*). This requires appropriate licences.

The figure below describes a simple but plausible research workflow,
starting with a (successful) funding request and culminating in a
scientific publication.

### Open data

The **data**, both in raw and processed form, and its annotation
(**metadata**) that accompanies a scientific paper (discovery) should
be freely/publicly available and should be free to re-use.

Note that open data goes beyond the release of scientific
data. [Governments](https://data.gov.uk/) and city councils are
publicly releasing data *to help people understand how government
works and how policies are made*.

### Open methodology

> An open methodology is simply one which has been described in
> sufficient detail to allow other researchers to repeat the work and
> apply it elsewhere (from Waton M., 2015)

Describe and release the process that lead raw data to processed data,
and how the processed data has been further analysed to lead to
results, figures and conclusions.

- **[Open source](http://opensource.org/osd)**: the source code of
  your (scienfic) software should be openly released, so that others
  can read/understand/fix/re-use it. (see
  [software licences](http://opensource.org/licenses))

- **Open protocols**: openly share the hole sample processing, data
  acquisition.

### Open access

Papers and supplementary material should be available to **read** and
**mine** by all, researchers and public.

Open peer review, open education

[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), for example),
... open scholarship

### Open Science

> Open science isn't a movement, it's just (good) science. It's also
> the future. (from Watson M, 2015)

- Moral argument
- Better science


Arguments against open Science:

- Too much unsorted information overwhelms scientists. 
- Science will be used for bad things.
- The public will misunderstand science data.
- Increasing the scale of science will make verification of any
  discovery more difficult.

(from the [Wikipedia Open Science page](Wikipedia Open Science page))

Some have also raised arguments about specific aspects of Open
Science, often founded on confusions or mis-understandings:

- open source and the lack commercial prospects in software
- open access and quality of publication
