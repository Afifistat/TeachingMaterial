# An Introduction to Machine Learning with R

This introductory workshop on machine learning with R is aimed at
participants who are not experts in machine learning (introductory
material will be presented as part of the course), but have some
familiarity with scripting in general and R in particular. The
workshop will offer a hands-on overview of typical machine learning
applications in R, including unsupervised (clustering, such as
hierarchical and k-means clustering, and dimensionality reduction,
such as principal component analysis) and supervised (classification
and regression, such as K-nearest neighbour and linear regression)
methods. We will also address questions such as model selection using
cross-validation. The material will have an important hands-on
component and participants will need to bring a computer with R 3.4.1
pre-installed. All the course material will be made available online
and package instructions will be circulated in advance.


# Content and objectives

# Why R?

# Overview of machine learning (ML)


In **supervised learning** (SML), the learning algorithm is presented
with labelled example inputs, where the labels indicate the desired
output. SML itself is composed of **classification**, where the output
is categorical, and **regression**, where the output is numerical.

In **unsupervised learning** (UML), no labels are provided, and the
learning algorithm focuses solelt on detecting structure in unlabelled
input data.

Note that there are also **semi-supervised learning** approaches that
use labelled data to inform unsupervised learning on the unlabelled
data to identify and annotate new classes in the dataset (also called
novely detection). 

**Reinforcement learning**, the learning algorithm performs a task
using feedback from operating in a real of synthetic environment.
