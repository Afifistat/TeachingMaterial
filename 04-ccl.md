# Conclusions

- We want to be open and transparency.
- Make sure we assure traceability of what we do.
- Make sure we and others can reproduce/replicate our work.
- Do it for you, do it for science.
- [When will *open science* become simply *science*?](http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0669-2)
- [This can not be an afterthought](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26191404);
  will never work that way. **Plan** for openness and
  reproducibility. It takes **discipline**, but very reasonable effort
  (given adequate tools) for substantial benerits.
- Make your data and code **suistainable** to have a chance to make
  the research reproducible/replicable.
