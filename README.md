Computational analysis using free, cross-platform scripting languages
such as R is becoming an increasingly common part of biological
research. For a scientist, knowledge of advanced programming
techniques can be extremely useful. Such skills are vital for writing
fast, reliable, maintainable programs, and using defensive programming
techniques can help to avoid the introduction of errors into code and
reduce the amount of time spent finding and fixing these
errors. Additionally, earning good practice in writing code can help
to ensure that scripts published and/or shared with the community are
robust and easy to maintain/develop.

This two-day course, delivered by experts in programming for data
analysis, will teach participants advanced techniques in writing
reliable, robust code in R. The material will provide the opportunity
to gain experience and understanding of object-oriented programming,
packaging your code for distribution, advanced approaches for data
visualisation, unit testing, and debugging. Sessions will be driven by
many practical exercises.
