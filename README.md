# Material for R/Bioconductor Proteomics Workshop at Stellenbosch University, October 2016

### Material

- [Introduction to R/RStudio](./R-intro/index.md)
- [R/Bioconductor for proteomics](./r4p/index.md)
- Data visualiation
- `mzR` and `MSnbase` packages for raw data
- Indentification data in `mzR`, `mzID`, `MSnID`
- The `MSnbase` package: `MSnSet`s for quantiative proteomics
- Experimental designs: biological and technical variability, blocking
  and randomization
- Handling missing values in proteomics data
- Differential expression of proteomics data (t-test for continuous
  data, count data, `limma`)
- Multiple testing
