TeachingMaterial
================

This repository is an aggregator for various teaching material used by several people to teach (mainly R). 
Most of the course are taught at the University of Cambridge, UK, and some have been adapted and exported outside. 
Each material subdirectory has its own repository; `TeachingMaterial` aggregates a snapshot as a central entry point. 
Aggregation is done using `git-subtree` and will be documented soon. 
The local copies are external repositories are prefixed with and underscore.
