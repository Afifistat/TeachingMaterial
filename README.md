**R object oriented programming** (roo) is and in-depth introduction to object oriented programming in `R`. 
It covers S3, S4 and S4 reference classes with ample examples and exercices. 
The working example of the course is a DNA/RNA class system that allows to read sequence data in fasta format, 
transcribe DNA into RNA, reverse, complement sequences, etc. 

The material is adequate for a full day course, giving the students time to implement the class systems themselves. 
It is used in various advanced programming and developement courses by Laurent Gatto and Robert StojniÄ‡ 
in Cambridge and at the EMBL.
