TeachingMaterial
================

This repository is an aggregator for various [R](http://www.r-project.org/) teaching material.
Most of the courses are taught at the University of Cambridge, UK, and some have been adapted and exported outside. 
Each material subdirectory has its own repository; `TeachingMaterial` aggregates a snapshot as a central entry point. 
Aggregation is done using `git-subtree` and will be documented soon. 
The local copies linking to external repositories are prefixed with an underscore. 

Unless otherwise stated, all material is licensed under a

This means you are free to copy, distribute and transmit the work, 
adapt it to your needs as long as you cite its origin and,

If you like this material and/or this initiative, do not hesitate to let us know
by starring the repo, tweet about it and mention it to your colleagues.
