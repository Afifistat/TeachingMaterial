A 1 day `R` introductory course for non-programmers, using
microarrays as main thread. Also includes an intro to Bioconductor and
the `eSet` infrastructure. Initially set up for the
[diXa](http://www.dixa-fp7.eu/dixa-training/dixa-training-agenda/dixa-microarray-training)
Microarray Analysis using R and Bioconductor training (see tags for
specific courses). Partially based on the
[Beginners guide to solving biological problems in `R`](http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/gsls/course/gsls-rintro)
(see also [here](http://logic.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/teaching/Rcourse/))
course by Robert StojniÄ‡, Rob Foy, John Davey, Laurent Gatto and Ian
Roberts.

## Slides

The slides provide a general introduction to `R` and the main data
structures. Scripting and plotting is presented by means of exercises
using microarray data as example. Finally, Bioconductor and the
microarray `eSet`/`ExpresionSet` classes are introduced and compared
to the previous introductory material and exercises.

## Exercises

1) Using `R` interactively and running a script.
2) [Vectors](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-02.md)
3) [How to store microarray data](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-03.md)

     microarray result data
5) [Another microarray analysis](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-05.md)
   - combining multiple expression matrices and produce a heatmap
   - extracting, parsing and visualising genes of interest
