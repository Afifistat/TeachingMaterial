## Minimal make: A minimal tutorial on make

I would argue that the most important tool for reproducible research
is [make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) (cf
[rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org)).

This is a minimal tutorial to get started.

View the thing [here](http://kbroman.github.io/minimal_make).

The source is in branch gh_pages.
