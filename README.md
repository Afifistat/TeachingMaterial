TeachingMaterial
================

This repository is an aggregator for various [R](http://www.r-project.org/) teaching material.
Most of the courses are taught at the University of Cambridge, UK, and some have been adapted and exported outside. 
Each material subdirectory has its own repository; `TeachingMaterial` aggregates a snapshot as a central entry point. 
Aggregation is done using `git-subtree` and will be documented soon. 
The local copies linking to external repositories are prefixed with an underscore.
