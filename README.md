A 1 day R introductionary course for non-programmers, using microarrays as main thread. Also includes an intro to Bioconductor and the `eSet` instrastructure. Initially set up for the [diXa](http://www.dixa-fp7.eu/dixa-training/dixa-training-agenda/dixa-microarray-training) Microarray Analysis using R and Bioconductor training (see the `2013-05-14_diXa_EBI` tag). Partially based on the [Beginners guide to solving biological problems in `R`](http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/gsls/course/gsls-rintro) (see also [here](http://logic.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/teaching/Rcourse/)) course by Robert StojniÄ‡, Rob Foy, John Davey, Laurent Gatto and Ian Roberts.
