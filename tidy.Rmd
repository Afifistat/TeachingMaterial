# Tidyverse

The **tidyverse**, popularised by Hadley Wickham, refers to the
utilisation of **tidy data** and **tools that preserve tidyness**.

We are going to 

* Learn how tidy data is defined for dataframes
* Learn some tidyverse tools
* Extend the notion of tidy data to Bioconductor's rich semantic

From http://tidyverse.org/:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
```

(but we are only going to use a subet of these packages)

## Tidy data

Just as

> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its
> own way. – Leo Tolstoy

when it comes to data

> Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its
> own way. – Hadley Wickham

The reason why tidy data is important is that we waste a lot of time
in cleaning *messy* data, i.e. tiding it up to get it in a format that
leads to data analysis and visualisation.

One reason why data is often messy is that its structure is meant to
make collection of the data easy.

The standard representation of data is in the form of a table. Tidy
tables are tables where:

1. Each variable is in a column.
2. Each observation is a row.
3. Each value is a cell.

### Examples

### The data

The *survey data* provides the species and weight of animals caught in
plots in various study area. The dataset is stored as a comma
separated value (CSV) file.  Each row holds information for a single
animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxa             | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |

It is available online
[https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169). We read it directly from figshare using `dplyr::read_csv`.

```{r}
surveys <- read_csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169")
head(surveys)
```

### Piping

When running complex operations on data, we often have to either
create temporary variables, or nest functions. An alternative is
piping operations using the `%>%` operator from the `magrittr`
package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("magrittr")
dim(surveys)
surveys %>% dim
```

This is particularly suited to tidy data and tidy tools. Instead of 

```
tidy_data_new <- tidy_tool1(tidy_data)
tidy_data_new <- tidy_tool2(tidy_data_new)
tidy_tool3(tidy_data_new)
```
we have
```
tidy_data %>% tidy_tool1 %>% tidy_tool2 %>% tidy_tools3
```

### Selecting variables (columns) with `select`

```{r}
surveys %>% select(species, plot_id, species_id)
```

### Selecting observations (rows) with `filter`

```{r}
surveys %>% filter(year == 1995)
```

Pipes come handy when we want to `select` and `filter`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species, sex, weight)
```

And to save the final, left-most, result

```{r, purl = FALSE}
sml <- surveys %>%
    filter(weight < 5) %>%
    select(species, sex, weight)
```

> ### Challenge 
>
>  Using pipes, subset the `survey` data to include individuals collected before
>  1995 and retain only the columns `year`, `sex`, and `weight`.

<!---
```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Answer
surveys %>%
    filter(year < 1995) %>%
    select(year, sex, weight)
```
--->

### Adding variables with `mutate`

```{r}
surveys %>%
    mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
    select(species, year, weight, weight_kg) 
```


```{r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
    mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
    select(species, year, weight, weight_kg) 
```

> ### Challenge
>
>  Create a new data frame from the `survey` data that meets the following
>  criteria: contains only the `species_id` column and a new column called
>  `hindfoot_half` containing values that are half the `hindfoot_length` values.

<!---
```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Answer
surveys_hindfoot_half <- surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length / 2) %>%
    filter(hindfoot_half < 30) %>%
    select(species_id, hindfoot_half)
```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine*
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. `dplyr` makes this very easy through the use of the
`group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to view the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```


#### Tallying

When working with data, it is also common to want to know the number of
observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this, `dplyr`
provides `tally()`. For example, if we wanted to group by sex and find the
number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  tally
```

Here, `tally()` is the action applied to the groups created by `group_by()` and
counts the total number of records for each category.

<!---
```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Answer 1
surveys %>%
    group_by(plot_type) %>%
    tally

## Answer 2
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    group_by(species_id) %>%
    summarize(
        mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length),
        min_hindfoot_length = min(hindfoot_length),
        max_hindfoot_length = max(hindfoot_length)
    )

## Answer 3
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(weight == max(weight)) %>%
    select(year, genus, species, weight) %>%
    arrange(year)

## Answer 4
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

## Extending tidy data

Note that sometimes, data is not tidy for good reasons - either for
performance reasons, or because of other valid conventions. 


Let's look at a well-known example:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("Biobase")
data(sample.ExpressionSet)
exprs(sample.ExpressionSet)[1:5, 1:5]
```

Typically, slots in the Bioconductor are not (necessarily) tidy. We
could make it tidy with:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("reshape2")
exprs(sample.ExpressionSet)[1:5, 1:3] %>% melt()
```

But that wouldn't be helpful for us, working in omics, and could even
counterproductive - see for example the
[Non-tidy data](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)
blog post.

But we can easily generalise the tidyverse concept:

From tidy data to adequately structured classes:

* Tidy data is data formatted as a table that guarantees that we know
  where to find variables (along columns), observations (along rows),
  and that each cell contains only one value.
  
* For S4 classes, that we use in Bioconductor to store complex data
  that do not fit in rectangular tables, we know where to find every
  bit of information too.

Tools that preserve data tidyness and endomorphism

* The `dplyr` tools take tidy data as input and guarantee to return
  tidy data. 
  
* We should write operations that preserve the classes of the
  data. Ideally, also define simple vocabulary that preserves the rich
  Bioconductor semantic in a consistent paradigm.

```{r, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
library("MSnbase")
library("msdata")
library("magrittr")

fl <- proteomics(full.names = TRUE)[2]
rw <- readMSData2(fl)
rw2 <- rw %>%
    filterMsLevel(3L) %>%
    filterMz(c(126, 132))
```
