# Weather data

Using the `weatherdata()` function from the `camweather` package,
download a weather data frame of your choice.

```{r}
library("camweather")
camweather()
x <- weatherdata("2013-03-13")
```

- What weather data is available? See `?weatherdata` and inspect the
  data frame's column names.

```{r}
names(x)
head(x)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?weatherdata
```

- What were the highest and lowest temperatures on that day? Hint: see
  `min`, `max` and/or `range` functions.

```{r}
x <- nounits(x)
range(x$Temp)
min(x$Temp)
max(x$Temp)
summary(x$Temp)
```

- The `Sun` and `Rain` values are cumulative from `Start`. What is the
  average rainfall per hours for that day? Hint: see `diff` for to
  calculate differences between successive values and `mean`.

```{r}
mean(diff(x$Rain))
mean(diff(x$Sun))
```

- In what direction has the wind blown most on that day? Hint:
  `table`.

```{r}
table(x$WindDr)
```
